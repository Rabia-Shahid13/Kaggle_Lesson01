pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = 1/2 * diameter
# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * radius * radius
# Check your answer
print (area)
